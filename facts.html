  <p class="w3-opacity"><i><H2 align=center>Facts About Avogadro</H2>
<p><b>Fact 1</b></p>
<p>He is most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, including what is known as Avogadro's law.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 2</b></p>
<p>In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in 1 mole of a substance, is known as the Avogadro constant.</p>
<p><b>Fact 3</b></p>
<p>In 1820, he became professor of physics at the University of Turin.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 4</b></p>
<p>Avogadro was active in the revolutionary movements of 1821 against King Victor Emmanuel I.</p>
<p><b>Fact 5</b></p>
<p>Eventually, King Charles Albert granted a Constitution (Statuto Albertino) in 1848. Well before this, Avogadro had been recalled to the university in Turin in 1833, where he taught for another twenty years.</p>
<p><b>Fact 6</b></p>
<p>Avogadro held posts dealing with statistics, meteorology, and weights and measures (he introduced the metric system into Piedmont) and was a member of the Royal Superior Council on Public Instruction.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 7</b></p>
<p>Avogadro is hailed as a founder of the atomic-molecular theory.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 8</b></p>
<p>Avogadro began his college education when he was only 13 years old and graduated at the age of 16.</p>
<p><b>Fact 9</b></p>
<p>By the time he was 20, he received his Ph.D.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 10</b></p>
<p>Though he followed the footsteps of his father to become a lawyer in 1796, he developed an interest for studying mathematics and physics along the way. This passion, turned him into a well-known physicist in his later years</p></i></p>
