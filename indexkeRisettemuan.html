  <p class="w3-opacity"><i><H2 align=center>Avogadro's Hypothesis</H2>
<P>In 1811 Avogadro published a paper in Journal de Physique, the French Journal of Physics. He said that the best explanation for Gay-Lussac's observations of gas reactions was that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. This is now called Avogadro's law. He published it when he was working as a physics teacher at the College of Vercelli.</P>
<p> Avogadro's (correct) view, the reason that two liters of hydrogen gas react with a liter of oxygen gas to form just two liters of gaseous water is that the volume decreases because the number of particles present decreases. Therefore the chemical reaction must be:</p>
<p style="border: 2px solid rgb(128, 64, 0);" align=center> 2H<sub>2 (gas)</sub> + O<sub>2 (gas)</sub> &#8594; 2H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>(gas)</sub> </p>
<p> In this reaction three particles (two hydrogen molecules and one oxygen molecule) come together to form two particles of water... or 200 particles react with 100 particles to form 200 particles... or 2 million particles react with 1 million particles to form 2 million particles... etc. The observable effect is that after the reaction, when all of the hydrogen and oxygen gases have become H<sub>2</sub>0 gas, the volume of gas falls to two-thirds of the starting volume. </p>
<p>As a result of these observations Avogadro became the first scientist to realize that elements could exist as molecules rather than as individual atoms. For example, he recognized that the oxygen around us exists as a molecule in which two atoms of oxygen are linked.</p>
<p>Other scientists in the field, such as Dalton, believed that only compounds could form molecules while all elements existed as single atoms.</p>
<p>Avogadro realized that elements could exist in the form of molecules with individual atoms joined together.</p>
<P>In 1815 Avogadro published a further paper in Journal de Physique discussing the masses of atoms, their compounds, and their gas densities.</P>
<p>In 1821, as professor of mathematical physics at the University of Turin, he published a further paper looking at the masses of atoms and the proportions in which they combine.</p>
<p>Between 1837 and 1841 Avogadro published four weighty volumes looking in detail at the physics of matter.</p>
<p>Avogadro's findings were almost completely ignored until Stanislao Cannizarro presented them at the Karlsruhe Conference in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death. This conference had been called to remedy the scientific confusion that existed about atoms, molecules, and their masses.</p>
<p>Even after Cannizarro presented his work not all scientists agreed with it. Another decade passed, with continued strong advocacy from Cannizarro, before Avogadro's hypothesis became more widely accepted and became Avogadro's Law.</p>
<p>Today Avogadro is regarded as one of the founders of atomic-molecular chemistry.</P>

<H2 align=center>Molecular Hypothesis of Combining Gases</H2>
<P>Avogadro is chiefly remembered for his molecular hypothesis, first stated in 1811, in which he claimed that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. He used this hypothesis further to explain the French chemist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac's law of combining volumes of gases (1808) by assuming that the fundamental units of elementary gases may actually divide during chemical reactions. It also allowed for the calculation of the molecular weights of gases relative to some chosen standard. Avogadro and his contemporaries typically used the density of hydrogen gas as the standard for comparison. Thus, the following relationship was shown to exist: </P>
<p align=center>Weight of 1 volume of gas or vapour /Weight of 1 volume of hydrogen = Weight of 1 molecule of gas or vapour /Weight of 1 molecule of hydrogen</p>
<p>To distinguish between atoms and molecules of different kinds, Avogadro adopted terms including molecule integrante (the molecule of a compound), molecule constituante (the molecule of an element), and molecule elementaire (atom). Although his gaseous elementary molecules were predominantly diatomic, he also recognized the existence of monatomic, triatomic, and tetratomic elementary molecules. In 1811 he provided the correct molecular formula for water, nitric and nitrous oxides, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen chloride. Three years later he described the formulas for carbon dioxide, carbon disulfide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. He also applied his hypothesis to metals and assigned atomic weights to 17 metallic elements based upon analyses of particular compounds that they formed. However, his references to gas metalliques may have actually delayed chemists' acceptance of his ideas. In 1821 he offered the correct formula for alcohol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O) and for ether (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O).</p>
Priority over who actually introduced the molecular hypothesis of gases was disputed throughout much of the 19th century. Avogadro's claim rested primarily upon his repeated statements and applications. Others attributed this hypothesis to the French natural philosopher Andre-Marie Ampere, who published a similar idea in 1814. Many factors account for the fact that Avogadro's hypothesis was generally ignored until after his death. First, the distinction between atoms and molecules was not generally understood. Furthermore, as similar atoms were thought to repel one another, the existence of polyatomic elementary molecules seemed unlikely. Avogadro also mathematically represented his findings in ways more familiar to physicists than to chemists. Consider, for example, his proposed relationship between the specific heat of a compound gas and its chemical constituents: 
<p align=center> 2 = p1c12 + p2c22 + etc.</p>
(Here c, c1, c2, etc., represent the specific heats at constant volume of the compound gas and its constituents; p1, p2, etc., represent the numbers of molecules of each component in the reaction). Based upon experimental evidence, Avogadro determined that the specific heat of a gas at constant volume was proportional to the square root of its attractive power for heat. In 1824 he calculated the "true affinity for heat" of a gas by dividing the square of its specific heat by its density. The results ranged from 0.8595 for oxygen to 10.2672 for hydrogen, and the numerical order of the affinities coincided with the electrochemical series, which listed the elements in the order of their chemical reactivities. Mathematically dividing an element's affinity for heat by that of his selected standard, oxygen, resulted in what he termed the element's "affinity number".Between 1843 and his retirement in 1850, Avogadro wrote four memoirs on atomic volumes and designated affinity numbers for the elements using atomic volumes according to a method "independent of all chemical considerations" a claim that held little appeal for chemists.</P>


<H2>Avogadro's Constant</H2>
<P>Avogadro's constant is one of the most important numbers in chemistry. Its value is 6.02214129 x 1023. Avogadro did not calculate this number, but its existence follows logically from his hypothesis and work.
Avogadro's constant is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in one mole of any substance. For example, 12 grams of carbon contains 6.02214129 x 1023 carbon atoms.
Avogadro's constant is an enormous number. If you could save a million dollars a second, it would take you longer than the universe is believed to have existed to save 6.02214129 x 1023 dollars; which all goes to show that it takes a lot of atoms to make a small amount of matter!</P></i></p>
