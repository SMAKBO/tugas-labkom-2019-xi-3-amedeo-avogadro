<H1>10 FACTS ABOUT AMEDEO AVOGADRO</H1>
<body>
<p><b>Fact 1</b></p>
<p>He is most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, including what is known as Avogadro's law.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 2</b></p>
<p>In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in 1 mole of a substance, is known as the Avogadro constant.</p>
<p><b>Fact 3</b></p>
<p>In 1820, he became professor of physics at the University of Turin.
</p>
<p><b>Fact 4</b></p>
<p>Avogadro was active in the revolutionary movements of 1821 against King Victor Emmanuel I.</p>
<p><b>Fact 5</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>act 10</b></p>
<p>Though he followed the footsteps of his father to become a lawyer in 1796, he developed an interest for studying mathematics and physics along the way. This passion, turned him into a well-known physicist in his later years</p></i></p>
